Genetic Influences on Brain Morphology, Head Circumference, and IQ in Monozygotic Twins

This repository contains the data and analysis code for a study investigating the genetic and environmental factors that influence brain size, shape, and intelligence (IQ) in monozygotic (MZ) twins. The study utilizes MRI data and statistical analysis to examine the heritability of various brain measures and their correlation with head circumference and IQ.
